*go fish!* is an experiment in using radio waves to convert text data→into sound→into radio waves *and back* into sound→into text and printing the final result on paper using a thermal printer.

It was made in two days by [Hannah Blows](http://thisblows.uk/), [Julia Zabowska](http://stheasy2remember.wix.com/juliazabowska) and [myself](http://andrefincato.info/), as part of a five day workshop titled [A(n) (im)practical introduction to Hertzian space](http://hackersanddesigners.nl/#/Modem%20Workshop)—held by [Dennis de Bel](http://www.dennisdebel.nl/test/) and [Roel Roscam Abbing](http://www.roelroscamabbing.nl/).
