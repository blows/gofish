><(((*> Radio Fishing ><(((*>

1. iPhone connected to a radio transmitter
2. iPhone connects to a website with prerecorded audio files
3. These prerecorded audio files are produced converting documents into audio signals using minimodem
4. A computer has a radio receiver that tune in to the waves of the audio files
5. This computer is also connected to a thermal printer
6. Once an iPhone comes close enough to the computer, a connection is established between the two devices, the radio-computer decodes the audio file and printswuwu it out!

Radio Fishing
Connect your phone to the rod. 
Hold the hook close to the screen. (Maybe the reciever and radio can be behind the screen, screen with the fish screensaver playing?)
Go fish! to see what you will catch.
